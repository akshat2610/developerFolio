  subTitle: emoji("My name is Akshat. I am a senior in Computer Science at San Jose State University. I interned at Sleep Number as a Cloud Engineer where I worked with multithreaded, performance-driven, and highly-scalable codebase. I was responsible for writing Java code to capture metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, API response times of many services that were deployed on AWS. I also built DataDog dashboards for monitoring the metrics that we captured and setting alerts for critical loads.\nI care deeply about the scalability, performance, and security of any code that I ship to production.
